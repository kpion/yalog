# yalog

A small project which helps me learn and test new things in JS.

A colorful browser console output. Plus (via built in plugin) a DOM console.
Only one file, no dependencies. 

You can see the demo here: https://kpion.github.io/yalog

## Setting it up

## Node

Will come soon.

## Directly in your web page:

Just download the only yalog.js file and:

```
<script src="yalog.js"></script>
<script>
yalog.log("works!");
</script>
```

Will later prepare the .min version and node stuff.
